## Pinecone WiFi

Pinecone is a WLAN networks auditing tool, suitable for red team usage. It is extensible via modules, and it is designed to be run in Debian-based operating systems. Pinecone is specially oriented to be used with a Raspberry Pi, as a portable wireless auditing box.

This tool is designed for educational and research purposes only. Only use it with explicit permission.

## Installation
For running Pinecone, you need a Debian-based operating system (it has been tested on Raspbian, Raspberry Pi Desktop and Kali Linux). Pinecone has the following requirements:
* **Python 3.5+**. Your distribution probably comes with Python3 already installed, if not it can be installed using `apt-get install python3`.
* **dnsmasq** (tested with version 2.76). Can be installed using `apt-get install dnsmasq`.
* **hostapd-wpe** (tested with version 2.6). Can be installed using `apt-get install hostapd-wpe`. If your distribution repository does not have a hostapd-wpe package, you can either try to install it using a [Kali Linux repository pre-compiled package](https://http.kali.org/pool/main/h/hostapd-wpe), or [compile it from its source code](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng/tree/master/patches/wpe/hostapd-wpe).

After installing the necessary packages, you can install the Python packages requirements for Pinecone using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the project root folder.

## Usage
For starting Pinecone, execute `python3 pinecone.py` from within the project root folder:
```
root@kali:~/pinecone# python pinecone.py 
[i] Database file: ~/pinecone/db/database.sqlite
pinecone > 
```

Pinecone is controlled via a Metasploit-like command-line interface. You can type `help` to get the list of available commands, or `help 'command'` to get more information about a specific command:
```
pinecone > help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
alias  help     load  pyscript  set    shortcuts  use
edit   history  py    quit      shell  unalias  

Undocumented commands:
======================
back  run  stop

pinecone > help use
Usage: use module [-h]

Interact with the specified module.

positional arguments:
  module      module ID

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

Use the command `use 'moduleID'` to activate a Pinecone module. You can use Tab auto-completion to see the list of current loaded modules:
```
pinecone > use 
attack/deauth     daemon/hostapd-wpe    report/db2json                  scripts/infrastructure/ap  
daemon/dnsmasq    discovery/recon       scripts/attack/wpa_handshake
pinecone > use discovery/recon 
pcn module(discovery/recon) > 
```

Every module has options, that can be seen typing `help run` or `run --help` when a module is activated. Most modules have default values for their options (check them before running):
```
pcn module(discovery/recon) > help run
usage: run [-h] [-i INTERFACE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INTERFACE, --iface INTERFACE
                        monitor mode capable WLAN interface (default: wlan0)
```

When a module is activated, you can use the `run [options...]` command to start its functionality. The modules provide feedback of their execution state:
```
pcn script(attack/wpa_handshake) > run -s TEST_SSID
[i] Sending 64 deauth frames to all clients from AP 00:11:22:33:44:55 on channel 1...
................................................................
Sent 64 packets.
[i] Monitoring for 10 secs on channel 1 WPA handshakes between all clients and AP 00:11:22:33:44:55...
```

If the module runs in background (for example, *scripts/infrastructure/ap*), you can stop it using the `stop` command when the module is running:
```
pcn script(infrastructure/ap) > run
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
[i] Creating NAT rules in iptables for forwarding wlan0 -> eth0...
[i] Starting hostapd-wpe and dnsmasq...
Configuration file: ~/pinecone/tmp/hostapd-wpe.conf
Using interface wlan0 with hwaddr 00:11:22:33:44:55 and ssid "PINECONEWIFI"
wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->ENABLED
wlan0: AP-ENABLED 
pcn script(infrastructure/ap) > stop
[i] Stopping hostapd-wpe and dnsmasq...
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
[i] Flushing NAT table in iptables...
```

When you are done using a module, you can deactivate it by using the `back` command. You can also activate another module issuing the `use` command again.

Shell commands may be executed with the command `shell` or the `!` shortcut:
```
pinecone > !ls
LICENSE  modules  module_template.py  pinecone  pinecone.py  README.md  requirements.txt  TODO.md
```

Currently, Pinecone reconnaissance SQLite database is stored in the *db/* directory inside the project root folder. All the temporary files that Pinecone needs to use are stored in the *tmp/* directory also under the project root folder.
